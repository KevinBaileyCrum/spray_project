# Spray Project
Is currently a work in progress.
Mountain Project is great and one of my favorite aspects of the site that Ive been playing with this past year involves ticking climbs.  One thing that is missing is a news feed for when your friends tick climbs.  Spray Project lets you add friends and see what they have been ticking.  

It is made with express backend and react frontend with a mongoDB for accounts and friendslist storage.  I feel like in hindsight the whole thing could have been built using soley React.js or Express.js as they are both sophisticated enough to meet the project's requirements however I've always wanted to work with both Express and React and I figured now is the chance.

## Deployment
I hope to deploy this project soon once it is up and running but feel free to clone and check it out as is.  Im also open to any PRs you'd have to offer however I should mention one of the main goals of this project was for me to learn about Express, React, Mongo.  That being said any feed back is welcome.  

### Express Backend
cd ./api run `npm run start-dev`
runs port 9000
### MongoDB
install local instance of mongoDB by following
`https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew`.
### React Frontend
cd ./clinet run `npm start`
runs port 3000
